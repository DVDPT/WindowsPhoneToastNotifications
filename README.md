Windows Phone Toast Notifications
==============================

Windows Phone Toast Notifications is an InApp notifications system for Windows Phone Silverlight apps. We will port it to Universal apps in the future (protip: you can fork and start the port ;) )

## Objectives

Windows Phone SDK does not provides any facility to display InApp toasts. Even if some alternatives exists,
they do not cover our needs.

Main features: 

- Display simple toast notification, 
- Display custom toast notification, 
- Handle notification queues, 
- Being able to update a notification content on the fly (like WP 8.1 Notification center toasts)

## Code samples

Look at the "WindowsPhoneToastNotifications.Demo" project.
